# Project Brief: Keepr

## Project Name
**Keepr** - Elastic Personal Archive

## One-Line Summary
A flexible, encrypted digital archive for storing anything - notes, credentials, media, files - with powerful search and tagging capabilities.

## Core Problem
Traditional tools are either too rigid (password managers only store credentials) or too insecure (generic notes apps lack encryption). Users need a unified place to store all types of digital information with control over security.

## Core Value Proposition
- Store **anything**: text, login info, images, videos, files
- **Elastic** structure: no predefined templates or categories
- **Powerful search**: text, filename, content-based search
- **Tag-based organization**: flexible filtering and discovery
- **Optional encryption**: user-controlled security per item
- **Minimalistic with soul**: clean design with personality

## Target User
Digital hoarders, power users, and anyone who accumulates diverse types of information and needs a unified, searchable archive with optional security.

## Core Features
1. **Multi-Type Storage**
   - Plain text notes
   - Login credentials (username, password, URL, notes)
   - Images (PNG, JPG, etc.)
   - Videos (MP4, MOV, M4V)
   - Any file type

2. **Organization & Discovery**
   - Tag system (multiple tags per item)
   - Feed view of all items
   - Filter by tags
   - Search by text/filename
   - Search inside file contents (optional)

3. **Authentication**
   - Email OR username login
   - Email verification via Gmail SMTP

4. **Security**
   - Optional per-item encryption on server
   - User controls what gets encrypted

5. **Design**
   - Minimalistic aesthetic
   - Unique visual identity ("with soul")
   - Clean, distraction-free interface

## Out of Scope (For Now)
- Mobile apps (web-first)
- Sharing/collaboration
- Import/export tools
- Two-factor authentication
- Folders/nested organization (tags only)

## Success Metrics
- Users can store any type of content within 3 clicks
- Search returns relevant results in <500ms
- Onboarding (email verification) completes in <2 minutes
